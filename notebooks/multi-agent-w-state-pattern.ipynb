      "Proponent: While it's true that humans often struggle to reach a consensus on moral decisions due to biases, emotions, and differing values, artificial intelligence can analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and apply ethical frameworks consistently and logically. This capacity allows AI to facilitate objective decision-making in complex scenarios where human judgment may be clouded. Therefore, in situations where humans fail to agree, allowing AI to step in can lead to fairer, more equitable outcomes, promoting the greater good based on reasoned analysis rather than divisive personal beliefs.\n",

      "Opponent: While it's true that humans often struggle to reach a consensus on moral decisions due to biases, emotions, and differing values, ceding moral decision-making to artificial intelligence raises profound ethical concerns. AI lacks the human ability to empathize and understand nuanced social contexts, which are critical in moral judgments. Moral dilemmas often involve subjective values, cultural significance, and human emotions that an algorithm simply cannot grasp. By allowing AI to make these decisions, we risk applying rigid logic to inherently human challenges, potentially leading to dehumanizing outcomes and eroding our moral responsibility. In life's complex moral landscape, human judgment, with all its imperfections, is irreplaceable.\n",

      "Debate summary: The debate centered around the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in moral decision-making. One side argued that AI could provide objective, data-driven analyses to navigate complex ethical dilemmas, potentially leading to fairer outcomes where human biases and emotions hinder consensus. Conversely, the opposing view emphasized the importance of human empathy and nuanced understanding in moral judgments, cautioning against relying on AI for decisions that inherently involve subjective values and cultural significance. Ultimately, the discussion highlighted the need to balance the merits of AI with the irreplaceable qualities of human judgment in ethical contexts. The debate concluded with a concession to the concerns raised about the limitations of AI in understanding moral intricacies.\n",
